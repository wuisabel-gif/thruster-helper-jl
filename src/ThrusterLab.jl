    ThrusterLab

An experimental platform for **thruster / actuator allocation and control-
authority analysis**.

A 6-DOF controller asks for a wrench `τ = [Fx, Fy, Fz, τx, τy, τz]`, but a
vehicle only has individual actuators `f = [f₁, …, fₙ]`. ThrusterLab builds the
allocation matrix `B` (so `τ = B f`), solves for `f` with a choice of algorithms
(`:minimum_norm`, `:weighted`, `:minimum_power`, `:qp`), and analyses the design
itself — rank, conditioning, redundancy, control authority, failure modes and
power.

The math is not underwater-specific: actuators are an `AbstractActuator`
hierarchy ([`Thruster`](@ref), [`ReactionWheel`](@ref), …), so AUVs, spacecraft
and omni-robots all flow through the same pipeline.

```julia
using ThrusterLab
vehicle = bluerov_vehicle()
τ = [1.0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5]                 # forward + yaw
result = allocate(vehicle, τ; method=:qp)  # respects thruster limits
report(result; actuators=vehicle.actuators)
report(diagnostics(vehicle))               # SVD-based design analysis
```

Graphical plots are available after `using Plots` (`plot_thrusters`,
`plot_vehicle`).
