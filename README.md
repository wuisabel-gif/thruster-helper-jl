# Thruster Helper

*Julia package: `ThrusterHelper.jl`*

A small, dependency-light **AUV thruster-allocation simulator** in Julia. Use it
to test how an underwater robot turns a desired 6-DOF motion command into
individual thruster pushes — and to debug thruster geometry, saturation, and
failures *before* you get in the water.

Aimed at robotics / RoboSub-style vehicles and control-system experiments.

## Background

I like building robotics software before building robotics hardware.

One lesson I learned from working on underwater robots is that many problems can
be discovered long before the vehicle touches the water. A controller might be
perfectly correct, yet the robot still cannot move the way you expect because
the thruster geometry is wrong. A vehicle may lose an entire degree of freedom
after one thruster fails. A layout might look symmetric but actually wastes
power because the allocation is poorly conditioned.

Thruster Helper started as an excuse to learn Julia while exploring these
problems. The project is intentionally small. It focuses on one task: given a
desired force and torque on an underwater vehicle, determine what each thruster
should do. Around that core idea are tools for understanding the vehicle
itself — its control authority, redundancy, failure modes, and power usage.

This is **not** intended to replace a flight controller or a ROS 2 control
stack. It is a lightweight simulator for experimenting with thruster layouts and
allocation algorithms. The goal is to keep it dependency-light and easy to read:
someone interested in underwater robotics should be able to understand the
entire allocation pipeline in an afternoon.

### Why Julia?

I wanted a language that makes numerical computing pleasant, and Julia feels
like a good middle ground:

- Interactive like Python
- Fast enough for heavy matrix computation
- Multiple dispatch makes linear-algebra code natural
- Excellent scientific-computing ecosystem
- Easy to prototype algorithms before rewriting them in C++ if necessary

Most of Thruster Helper is simply linear algebra — exactly the kind of work Julia
was designed for.

---

## The problem it solves

An AUV controller does not command individual motors. It asks the vehicle to
generate a wrench (force + torque):

```text
τ = [Fx, Fy, Fz, τx, τy, τz]
     │   │   │   │   │   └─ τz = yaw
     │   │   │   │   └───── τy = pitch
     │   │   │   └───────── τx = roll
     │   │   └───────────── Fz = heave
     │   └───────────────── Fy = sway
     └───────────────────── Fx = surge
```

but the vehicle only has individual thrusters:

```text
f = [f1, f2, …, fN]
```

Thruster Helper builds the **allocation matrix** `B` so that

```text
τ = B f
```

and then solves the inverse problem for the actuator commands — with a choice of
algorithms, not just the pseudo-inverse:

```text
f = allocate(B, τ; method = :minimum_norm)   # f = pinv(B) τ
                 | :weighted                  # penalise chosen actuators
                 | :minimum_power             # minimise Σ|fᵢ|^1.5  (IRLS)
                 | :qp                        # best wrench within ±limits
```

so Thruster Helper is a small **framework for comparing allocation methods**, not a
single `pinv` wrapper.

### Core concept

Each thruster contributes a force (its push direction) and a torque
(`position × direction`), so it becomes one column of `B`:

```text
B[:, i] = [ direction_x
            direction_y
            direction_z
            (position × direction)_x
            (position × direction)_y
            (position × direction)_z ]
```

`pinv(B)` returns the **minimum-effort** (least-‖f‖) solution that hits the
command, or the least-squares closest wrench when the geometry can't fully
achieve it.

That sounds simple, but many interesting questions appear immediately — and
they are exactly what this project tries to answer:

- Is every degree of freedom controllable?
- Which thruster contributes most to yaw?
- What happens after a thruster failure?
- Which motors saturate first?
- How much extra power does redundancy cost?

## Install / run

Requires Julia ≥ 1.9 (the optional Plots support uses package extensions, which
need 1.9+).

Once registered (see [Publishing](#publishing)) it installs with
`Pkg.add("ThrusterHelper")`. From a local clone:

```bash
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'   # one-time
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'          # run the test suite
julia --project=. examples/forward.jl                 # run an example
```

The core has **no third-party dependencies** (only the `LinearAlgebra`, `Printf`
and `Random` standard libraries). Graphical plotting is optional and only pulls
in `Plots` if you ask for it (see [Plotting](#plotting)).

---

## Quick start

```julia
using ThrusterHelper

# A built-in 8-thruster vehicle (BlueROV2 Heavy / RoboSub style).
vehicle = bluerov_vehicle()

# Ask for a motion: forward + yaw right.
τ = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5]

# Solve for thruster commands (saturation-aware QP here).
result = allocate(vehicle, τ; method = :qp)
report(result; actuators = vehicle.actuators)

# Analyse the design itself, separately from any one command.
report(diagnostics(vehicle))
```

Allocation report (abridged):

```text
Actuator commands:
  front-right-horiz        0.7553   |████████████████████
  front-left-horiz        -0.0482  █|
  back-right-horiz        -0.7553  ████████████████████|
  ...
Summary:
  total |command|     : 1.6071
  est. power          : 1.3341 W
  most-loaded actuator: back-right-horiz (-0.7553)
  rank / condition #  : 6/6  ,  κ = 4.545
```

## The `Vehicle` and actuators

An actuator is anything that turns a scalar command into a 6-DOF wrench — the
`AbstractActuator` interface. The built-in `Thruster` is a position, a push
**direction** (auto-normalised), and a `max_thrust`. Convention: **x forward,
y left, z up**, positions about the centre of mass. Bundle actuators into a
`Vehicle` so the API reads naturally:

```julia
thrusters = [
    Thruster("port-surge", [0.2,  0.15, 0.0], [1, 0, 0]; max_thrust = 40.0),
    Thruster("stbd-surge", [0.2, -0.15, 0.0], [1, 0, 0]; max_thrust = 40.0),
    Thruster("port-heave", [0.0,  0.15, 0.0], [0, 0, 1]; max_thrust = 40.0),
    Thruster("stbd-heave", [0.0, -0.15, 0.0], [0, 0, 1]; max_thrust = 40.0),
]
vehicle = Vehicle("my-auv", thrusters; mass = 12.0)

allocation_matrix(vehicle)        # 6×N matrix B
allocate(vehicle, τ; method = :qp)
diagnostics(vehicle)              # rank, conditioning, control authority …
describe(vehicle)                 # geometry table
```

`Thruster` is **immutable** — a vehicle does not move its thrusters at run time;
build a new one to change geometry. Built-in layouts: `bluerov_heavy(; arm,
span)` / `bluerov_vehicle()` (8 thrusters, fully actuated) and `simple_quad(;
arm)` / `quad_vehicle()` (4 horizontal thrusters; surge/sway/yaw only).

---

## Allocation solvers

`allocate(B_or_vehicle, τ; method = …)` chooses the algorithm. All are
dependency-free (built on `LinearAlgebra`).

| `method` | Solves | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `:minimum_norm` / `:pinv` | min ‖f‖₂ s.t. `Bf = τ` | default, least-effort |
| `:weighted` | min ‖W f‖₂ s.t. `Bf = τ` | penalise weak / suspect actuators (`weights=`) |
| `:minimum_power` | min Σ\|fᵢ\|ᵖ s.t. `Bf = τ` (IRLS, p≈1.5) | lower electrical draw |
| `:qp` | min ‖Bf − τ‖² s.t. `lo ≤ f ≤ hi` | respect saturation limits optimally (`bounds=`) |

`allocate` returns an `AllocationResult` with `commands`, `desired`, `achieved`
(`= B·commands`) and `residual` (`achieved − desired`). A non-zero residual is
the headline diagnostic: the geometry — or the surviving thrusters after a
failure — cannot meet the command. See `examples/solver_comparison.jl`.

> **Why not just use `pinv`?** `pinv(B) τ` is the right answer to a narrower
> question — least-‖f‖ with *no other constraints*. It silently ignores
> saturation limits, electrical power, failed thrusters and per-actuator
> weighting. Thruster Helper exists to handle exactly those: `:qp` respects limits,
> `:minimum_power` targets draw, `:weighted` steers around weak actuators,
> `apply_failures` models dead ones, and `reachable` tells you when *no* command
> suffices. `:minimum_norm` is still there for when `pinv` really is what you want.

---

## Design diagnostics

Allocation tells you the thrust values; **diagnostics** tell you whether the
*design* is any good. `diagnostics(B_or_vehicle)` returns an
`AllocationDiagnostics` with:

- `rank` — `6` ⇒ fully actuated; lower ⇒ DOFs are uncontrollable.
- `redundancy` — `N − rank`, the null-space / spare control dimension.
- `condition_number` — `σ_max/σ_min`; large ⇒ some directions need far more thrust.
- `manipulability` — `√det(B Bᵀ)`, volume of the achievable-wrench ellipsoid.
- `controllable` — `Bool` per DOF `[Fx, Fy, Fz, τx, τy, τz]`.
- `singular_values`, `weakest_direction`, `weakest_gain` — the SVD picture.

```julia
report(diagnostics(vehicle))
```

```text
Design diagnostics  (6 DOF × 8 actuators)
  rank               : 6 / 6  (fully actuated)
  redundancy (null)  : 2
  condition number κ : 4.545  (well-conditioned)
  manipulability     : 0.4819
  control authority  : Fx ok  Fy ok  Fz ok  τx ok  τy ok  τz ok
  singular values    : [2.0, 1.414, 1.414, 0.622, 0.44, 0.44]
  weakest direction  : τx-dominated, gain σ_min = 0.44
```

The LinearAlgebra primitives the analysis is built on (`rank`, `cond`, `svd`,
`svdvals`, `nullspace`, `eigen`, `pinv`) are re-exported, so `using ThrusterHelper`
is enough to reach for them directly on `B`.

## Analysis & design tools

Built on the core, these answer the questions a vehicle *designer* asks:

| Tool | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| `reachable(vehicle, τ)` | Can the vehicle produce this wrench within its limits? If not, what's the closest, and which thrusters saturate? |
| `compare_methods(vehicle, τ)` | Which solver wins here? Tabulates residual, ‖f‖₂, power, saturation, time. |
| `rank_failures(vehicle; pairs=…)` | How critical is each thruster? Rank/κ change and lost DOFs for every failure (or pair). |
| `monte_carlo(vehicle; misalignment_deg, failure_prob, …)` | How robust is the design? P(lose each DOF) and the κ distribution over thousands of perturbed builds. |
| `optimize_layout(vehicle; objective, free)` | **Design**, not just analyse: re-aim (and/or move) thrusters to minimise κ or maximise manipulability. |

```julia
reachable(vehicle, [30, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])      # "Fx = 30 N? Vehicle tops out at 22 N." → NOT REACHABLE
report(compare_methods(vehicle, τ))          # solver trade-off table
report_failures(rank_failures(vehicle))      # failure criticality ranking
report(monte_carlo(vehicle; misalignment_deg=2.0, failure_prob=0.05))

# Turn an analysis library into a design tool:
res = optimize_layout(bluerov_vehicle(; arm=0.1); objective=:condition_number)
report(res)        # κ: 10.0 → 7.2 by re-aiming thrusters, still full rank
```

The optimiser is a dependency-free pattern search with random restarts; pass
`free=:both` and a `position_box` to move thrusters as well as re-aim them, or a
custom `objective = vehicle -> …` to minimise. See the `reachability.jl`,
`compare_methods.jl`, `failure_analysis.jl`, `monte_carlo.jl` and
`optimize_layout.jl` examples.

## Beyond AUVs

The math is not underwater-specific — any rigid body whose actuators sum to a
wrench fits. Actuators are an `AbstractActuator` hierarchy, so a spacecraft
`ReactionWheel` (pure torque about an axis) drops into the same pipeline:

```julia
wheels = [ReactionWheel("rw$i", axis) for (i, axis) in enumerate(pyramid_axes)]
sat = Vehicle("CubeSat", wheels; mass = 4.0)
report(diagnostics(sat))         # τx/τy/τz controllable; forces are not
allocate(sat, [0,0,0, 0,0,0.1])  # command a yaw torque
```

See `examples/spacecraft_reaction_wheels.jl`. New actuator types (propellers,
wheels) just implement `wrench_column` and `command_limits`.

---

## Plotting

Plotting is an optional [package extension](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Conditional-loading-of-code-in-packages-(Extensions)).
The core never loads `Plots`; it activates only when you do:

```julia
using ThrusterHelper
using Plots                      # triggers ThrusterHelperPlotsExt

vehicle = bluerov_vehicle()
r = allocate(vehicle, [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5]; method = :qp)
plot_vehicle(vehicle; commands = r.commands, failed = [1, 5], view = :xy)
```

`view` can be `:xy` (top-down), `:xz` (side) or `:yz` (rear). Forward thrust is
green, reverse is red, failed thrusters are greyed with an ✕. (`plot_thrusters`
takes the actuator vector directly.)

`plot_manipulability(vehicle; block=:force)` draws the 3-D **manipulability
ellipsoid** — the set of wrenches reachable with a unit command ball. Its long
axes are cheap-to-produce directions; the short (red) axis is the design's weak
spot. See `examples/plot_ellipsoid.jl`.

---

## Math reference

For thruster `i` with position `rᵢ` and unit push direction `dᵢ`:

```text
force_i  = dᵢ                      (3×1)
torque_i = rᵢ × dᵢ                 (3×1)
B[:,i]   = [ force_i ; torque_i ]  (6×1)

τ = B f                            (forward: command → wrench)
f = allocate(B, τ; method = …)     (inverse: wrench → command)
```

When `B` has full row rank (6), every wrench is achievable and the residual is
~0. Drop below rank 6 (under-actuated layout, or enough failed thrusters) and
some DOFs become uncontrollable — `diagnostics` and `residual` tell you which
and how much. The SVD `B = U Σ Vᵀ` underlies the analysis: `rank` counts the
non-zero σ, `condition_number = σ_max/σ_min`, the smallest σ and its left
singular vector give the **weakest direction**, and `nullspace(B)` is the
redundant control the over-actuation buys.

---

## Roadmap / future ideas

Done so far: multiple allocation solvers (`:minimum_norm`, `:weighted`,
`:minimum_power`, `:qp`), SVD-based diagnostics, reachability analysis, a
method-comparison report, failure-criticality ranking, Monte-Carlo robustness,
a layout **optimiser**, an `AbstractActuator`/`Vehicle` abstraction and a power
model — the v1→v3 (allocation → diagnostics → design optimisation) arc.

Still on the list:

- Nonlinear thruster curves (PWM ↔ thrust) and dead-bands
- Battery voltage-sag model
- Hydrodynamic drag model
- PID / LQR controller-in-the-loop simulation
- Mission-level energy optimisation
- Symbolic Jacobian / sensitivity (`Symbolics.jl`)
- Export `B` / `pinv(B)` to C++ / ROS 2
- Interactive GUI

## Publishing

This package is registration-ready for Julia's **General registry** (name
`ThrusterHelper` is free, `[compat]` and license are set, tests pass, CI /
TagBot / CompatHelper workflows are in `.github/workflows/`). To register:

1. **Make the repository public** — the General registry only accepts public
   source. (Conventionally the repo is also renamed to `ThrusterHelper.jl`.)
2. Comment **`@JuliaRegistrator register`** on the latest commit. The bot opens a
   PR to [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General); new packages
   auto-merge after a ~3-day waiting period.
3. After merge, `TagBot` tags the release and users can `Pkg.add("ThrusterHelper")`.

Until then, it installs straight from Git:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/wuisabel-gif/thruster-helper-jl")
```
